# Software-Engineering-Links-And-Lessons-Learned
List of all the lessons learned, best practices, and links that I've accumulated in my software engineering career (ongoing)
There is something that I'd like to clear out from the get-go. My career has been focused around the .NET platform and most of the tips and tricks along with lessons learned may be explained through .NET but they can be applied in any programming language. Don't be driven away by the fact that I've expressed a best practice in C# when you either don't (like it / know it). Any concept can be applied in your language of your choice. I feel we should focus on that instead of the small technical details like a programming language.
